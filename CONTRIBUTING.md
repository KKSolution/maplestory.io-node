## Getting Started

### Our Purpose

This project's mission is to provide unofficial APIs relating to the MMORPG, MapleStory which is provided by [NEXON](http://nexon.net).
Any pull requests, issues, or otherwise requests that stray away from this purpose may be rejected.

### Our Legal Commitment

As a company, Crrio is required to abide by [NEXON](http://nexon.net)'s legal requirements and terms requiring that we state that all aspects of our service and APIs are the following:
  * Un-official, and not directly affiliated by Nexon America, or NEXON.
  * All assets and information regarding their game(s) are owned by them, including any information collected lawfully via their website.
  * All applications, services, or other methods that take advantage of our APIs must be publically accessible or private without any monitization.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Bug Reports

Bugs can happen, and they usually make for a bad experience for everyone. Whenever a bug report is created, we will usually quickly act upon it, research the causes, and apply a fix when possible.
Bug Reports are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

#### What Is A Bug?

* **An entire API or section of our website being in-accessible!** Sometimes changes or updates can un-intentionally break something on our service. These are good to report either on Github, or on our Discord.
* **An API isn't acting as intended!** Sometimes you really want a brand new Tyrant Glove, and you get a rock. We understand. If an API is giving an incorrect response or doesn't match it's documentation, please let us know here.

#### What Is Not A Bug?

* **A shop is missing from the market APIs!** As a service, MapleStory.io is provided in-game information from a 3rd party source unaffiliated with Crrio, and as such we're unfortunutely unable to resolve any problems related to data provided through these APIs.
If you would however still like to report an issue, please email us at [help@crr.io](mailto:help@crr.io).
* **Items are missing from /item/ and /itemlist/!** A majority of our APIs are powered by data already located on our servers, which requires manual updating. This can lead to certain items or information being behind the live version, or otherwise appear to be missing specific items.
When this occurs, please let us know via our Discord and we'll usually try to resolve it by the end of the week.

### Feature Requests

Every single individual sees the world in a different light, and we're appreciative of those that can imagine creative ways to better or improve MapleStory.io for everyone.
Feature requests are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

#### Making A Feature Request

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the request.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the feature** in as many details as possible.
* **Explain why this feature would be useful** to most MapleStory players and generally benefits the service in some manner.

We believe in quality not quantity, so we prefer well thought-out APIs and features over creating many of them with limited functionality or usage.
